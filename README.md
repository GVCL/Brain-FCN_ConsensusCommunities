# Brain-FCN_ConsensusCommunities

# Communities and Cliques in Functional Brain Network Using Multiscale Consensus Approach
This project is a study of brain functional connectivity networks. The correlation matrices extracted from fMRI data are used and applied multiscale EFA to generate consensus communities and cliques that correspond to relevant brain activity in its resting state.

## R Code
Please check for the working directory (getwd()) and place the folder at the location, before you run the code.

## MATLAB
We have used BrainNet Viewer, a tool to visulalize the ommunities and cliques on the brain surface in axial view.
